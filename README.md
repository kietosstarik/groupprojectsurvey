Surveys for Movies
Surveys for Movies is an app that makes it easy to get your ideal travel destinations with travel information based off your movie interests. Enter your name and location, then click on the submit button. Next, take the short survey and you'll be shown the top three movie recommendations based on your survey answers along with the corresponding movie names, release dates, posters, and movie rating. In addition, the film location will be displayed for your top recommendation. Click on the Directions button at the bottom of the page to be given directions from your location to the area the movie was filmed.

DOCUMENTATION for Heroku

PROBLEM: We made changes to our app after deploying it to Heroku with the assumption that Heroku would automatically update the app when a new push was made to Github. 

SOLUTION: New work needs to be pushed to Github first. Then a <git push heroku master> command can be executed in order to update Heroku with the latest app code.
-----------------------------------------------------
1 . Create an account on https://heroku.com. This should be pretty straight forward. 

2 . Install the Heroku CLI on your computer: 
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli. Check that you have the heroku-cli installed by checking the version number in your terminal:

heroku --version

3 . Connect the Heroku CLI to your account by writing the following command in your terminal and follow the instructions on the command line:

heroku login

Use your credentials from the earlier account creation.
